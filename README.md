I just wanted to scrape the titles.

## Motivation
I've been collecting Calvin and Hobbes comic books since middle school. However, I lost track of which books I have and don't have.
Thus, I decided to scrape the Wikipedia page for the list of all books and made a list to check off which ones I had.

Probably could have just copy and pasted each title individually, but why do that when I can use web scraping?

After cross checking, the only books I don't have are:
* The Revenge of the Baby-Sat
* Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes
* The Complete Calvin and Hobbes (paperback and hardcover)
* Exploring Calvin and Hobbes: An Exhibition Catalogue
